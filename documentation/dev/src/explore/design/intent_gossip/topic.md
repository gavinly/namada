# Topic

A topic is string and an encoding that describes this sub-network. In a topic
all intents use the exact same encoding. That encoding is known by matchmakers
so it can decode them to find matches. Whenever a node subscribes to a new topic
it informs all connected nodes and each of them propagate it. With this itâ€™s
easy to create new topics in the intent gossip network and inform others.

Other nodes can choose to subscribe to a new topic with the help of a
filter. This filter is defined as a combination of a whitelist, a regex
expression, and a maximum limit.
